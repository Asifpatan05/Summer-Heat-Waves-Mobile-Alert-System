**1. Data Collection and Analysis**
Historical Weather Data: Gather data on temperature, humidity, and other relevant weather parameters.
Health Data: Collect data on heat-related illnesses and mortality rates.
Demographic Data: Include data on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as heat index, consecutive hot days, etc.
Normalization/Standardization: Scale the data for better model performance.

**3. Develop Predictive Models**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns and correlations.
Model Selection: Choose appropriate models such as Time Series Analysis, Regression Models, or Machine Learning algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
Model Training and Validation: Split the data into training and testing sets, train the models, and validate their performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.

**4. Integration with Mobile Platforms**
API Development: Create APIs to serve the predictions and alerts.
Mobile App Development: Develop a mobile app (or integrate with existing ones) to display alerts and provide safety tips.
User Interface (UI): Design a user-friendly interface to ensure accessibility and ease of use.

**5. Real-time Data Processing and Alerts**
Real-time Data Ingestion: Set up a system to ingest real-time weather data.
Continuous Model Updating: Ensure the predictive models are regularly updated with new data.
Alert Generation: Develop a logic to generate alerts based on predicted heatwave conditions.

**4. Testing and Deployment**
Beta Testing: Test the system with a small group of users to gather feedback.
Deployment: Deploy the system to production and monitor its performance.
Feedback Loop: Collect feedback from users and continuously improve the system.

**5. Community Engagement and Education**
Awareness Campaigns: Educate the public about the dangers of heatwaves and how to stay safe.
User Training: Provide training on how to use the mobile app and understand the alerts.
